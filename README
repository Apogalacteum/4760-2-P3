This program is not complete. I did what I could with the little time that I had. 
I emailed you to explain my situation and I appreciate the extra time you gave me
but I couldn't complete it. I'm nodding off into my textbook as I try to learn about
share memory. I have to wake up for work in about 5 hours. I'm gonna bow out for now.
I'm going to try to finish it anyway in the off chance that you meant Tuesday next week.
